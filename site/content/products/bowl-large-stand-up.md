Bowl - Large - Stand-Up. Designed originally for a large 'head' lettuce this bowl has a square section or foot to enable it to stand and face the customer and also has the option of a 'C' cut allowing air to circulate in the bowl. This can be removed if not required. At approx. 200mm diameter this bowl is perfect for a wide variety of salad and leaf products and is particularly useful for a stand-up option in-store. The closure is heat seal or stretch wrap and the material could be standard or extended shelf life depending on the product and requirement.
