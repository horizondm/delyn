Delyn team members are celebrating in two different areas. Our production Manager Konrad and his wife Kataryzna have reached new heights. As part of a team they yesterday 14th November 2019 reached base camp Everest along with the Delyn Flag. Both Konrad and Kataryzna have both been challenged with altitude sickness so this is a fantastic achievement. Congratulations.
